tfscolorizer
============

The TFS Colorizer plugin for Chrome

This allows you to customize the colors of items on a TFS board depending on their content.
By default, Microsoft's Team Foundation Server (TFS) board shows every task card in the same blue color.  

It's a lot easier to see the status of a project when you can see at a glance if the tasks your waiting for are development, testing, or documentation.  

This plugin lets you customize the color of the cards based on their text, showing "Development" in green, "Testing" in orange, and so-on.  The plugin will also show you your own tasks in BOLD.
